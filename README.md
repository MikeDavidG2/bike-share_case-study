# bike-share_case-study
## A case study of real-world bike-share data acting as a capstone project for my Google Data Analytics Certificate.

### Background
Cyclistic is a fictional bike-sharing company that owns more than 5,800 bicycles and over 600 docking stations in the city of Chicago, IL.  Since their launch in 2016, Cyclistic has focused their marketing strategy on boosting general awareness and engaging broad consumer segments.  In order to appeal to the largest possible consumer base, Cyclistic has pricing plans for casual riders (**CR**) via single-rides & day passes, and annual memberships (**AM**).

The annual memberships have been found to be much more profitable to the company vs. the casual single & day passes.  Instead of trying to sell annual memberships to all-new customers, the Cyclistic marketing team has decided to develop a marketing campaign to convert their casual riders into annual members.

### Business Task
In order to create a successful marketing campaign, the Cyclistic marketing team first needs to understand how the CRs use the Cyclistic bikes differently from their AMs.

Cyclisticâ€™s trip data for one year spanning *9/1/23 - 8/31/2024* will be analyzed to answer:

- **What distinguishes a casual rider from an annual member?**
  - How many casual rides vs. annual member rides took place during the analysis year?
  - How long do casual riders ride vs. annual members?
  - What bike type do casual riders prefer?
  - Where do casual riders ride?
  - When do casual riders ride?
